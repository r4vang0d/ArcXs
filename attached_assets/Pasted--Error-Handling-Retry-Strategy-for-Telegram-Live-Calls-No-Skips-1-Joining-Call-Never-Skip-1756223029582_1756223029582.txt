🔒 Error Handling & Retry Strategy for Telegram Live Calls (No Skips)

1. Joining Call (Never Skip)

Each account attempts to join.

If join fails (invalid group call, FloodWait, connection reset):

Retry with exponential backoff → 2s → 5s → 10s → 30s → 1m … up to 1h.

Queue system: account keeps retrying in background until success.

Only give up if the live stream itself ends (detected via GroupCallEnded).



✅ This guarantees all accounts eventually join.

2. Raise Hand Logic

Immediately after joining → send GroupCallParticipant.raise_hand().

If rejected (admin doesn’t approve):

Keep muted, but retry raise hand every 2–5 minutes.


If approved:

Start mute/unmute cycle (see below).




---

3. Persistent Presence (Never Quit)

Accounts must not leave until:

Host/admin ends the live, OR

The session dies permanently (account banned, deleted).


Auto-reconnect if dropped unexpectedly.

Detect call status:

CallActive → stay in.

CallEnded → gracefully exit.

4. Mute / Unmute Random Behavior

Once admin allows mic:

Run a background randomizer:

Mute for 1–5 min.

Unmute for 10–30s.

Repeat.



If admin mutes you → respect it, stay muted until allowed again.

Prevent “spammy” toggles by enforcing min 30s between changes.

5. FloodWait Handling (Critical Fix)

If account gets FloodWaitError:

Sleep for exact wait time (FloodWait.seconds).

Resume retrying automatically after wait ends.


Meanwhile, other accounts continue unaffected.



---

6. Account Health (Self-Healing)

Continuous monitoring:

If account gets permanently banned → mark in DB as dead.

If session expires → auto-refresh with login.

If too many failures (>50 retries) → alert admin, but still keep retrying.




---

7. Master Orchestrator

Central controller (can be Aiogram bot itself) manages:

All Telethon sessions.

Retry queues for each account.

Random mute/unmute cycle.

Admin alerts if issues persist.



This way:

You never lose an account.

You never skip failures.

Every account eventually sits in the call until it ends.

🔧 Tools (Non-Optional)

Telethon + PyTgCalls → joining + voice/video call handling.

Aiogram → admin control UI, monitoring, logging.

SQLite/Redis → persistence for sessions + retry counters.

Task Queue (asyncio / aiojobs) → handle retries per account.
