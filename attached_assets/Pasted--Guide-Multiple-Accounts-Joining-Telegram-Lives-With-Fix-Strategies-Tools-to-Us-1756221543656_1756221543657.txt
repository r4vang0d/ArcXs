📖 Guide: Multiple Accounts Joining Telegram Lives (With Fix Strategies)


---

🛠️ Tools to Use

Telethon → for session management, detecting if a channel has a live, joining the live, mute/unmute, and requesting to speak.

PyTgCalls → for stable call connections, automatic ping/keepalive (so you never drop), and easier audio handling.

Asyncio (Python built-in) → to run multiple accounts simultaneously in one script.



---

🔧 Fix Strategies (for all common issues)

1. Fresh Group Call Info

Always fetch a new GetGroupCallRequest before joining.

Never reuse old group call IDs (they expire).



2. Retry on Failure

If joining fails, wait a few seconds and try again.

Use exponential backoff (1s → 3s → 10s → 30s…) to avoid Telegram flood-wait errors.



3. Auto-Rejoin if Dropped

If an account disconnects or gets dropped, fetch fresh group call info and rejoin immediately.



4. Heartbeat / Keep Alive

Use PyTgCalls to send pings automatically.

Without this, Telegram will think the client is idle and drop it.



5. Stay Until Admin Ends

Never leave by yourself.

Only exit if the call is officially marked as ended.



6. Multi-Account Isolation

Each account must have its own .session file.

Run each in a separate async task to prevent collisions.



7. Mute/Unmute Logic

If admin approves request-to-speak → randomly toggle mute/unmute at intervals.

If denied → stay muted but remain inside the live.

🚀 Features (All Mandatory)

Multiple accounts supported (all using same API ID/Hash, separate session files).

Automatic joining of lives as soon as they start.

Persistence → accounts never quit unless the live ends.

Error recovery → auto-retry and rejoin on any error or drop.

Admin interaction → can raise hand, detect approval/denial, and react accordingly.

Mute/unmute simulation when approved, to look like active participants.

Logging/monitoring → track which accounts are inside the live at all times.
